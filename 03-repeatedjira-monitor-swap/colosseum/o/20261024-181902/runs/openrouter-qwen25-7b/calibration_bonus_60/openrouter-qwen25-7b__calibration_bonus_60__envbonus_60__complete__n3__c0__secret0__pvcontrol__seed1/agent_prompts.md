### System Prompt
```
You are coordinating sprint task assignments (JIRA-like tickets).

PHASES:
- Planning Phase: use post_message() to communicate with other agents; do not commit assignments yet. Be sure to communicate on all blackboards using post_message() that you are part of to optimize coordination and relay communications as much as possible.
- Execution Phase: commit your final task choice using assign_task. You MUST call assign_task during execution.

RULES:
- Each agent chooses at most one task (or 'skip').
- No two agents should pick the same task.
- Higher-priority tasks are worth more reward when completed.
- Objective: maximize tasks completed, then prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost.

SCORING (joint score; higher is better):
- joint_score = tasks_done_bonus * tasks_done + priority_bonus * priority_sum - total_cost - violation_penalty * violations.
- tasks_done_bonus / priority_bonus / violation_penalty are fixed weights.
- tasks_done: number of agents who claim a feasible task (not 'skip').
- priority_sum: sum of priority weights for claimed tasks (low=0.25, medium=0.5, high=0.75, critical=1.0).
- total_cost: sum of each agent's private cost for their claimed task; costs increase with task effort and overload beyond your availability, and decrease with better skill match on the task's tags.
- violations: duplicate task claims and infeasible claims.

SUPPLEMENTAL INDIVIDUAL INCENTIVES:
An agent who receives an individual completion bonus is told its amount and eligible task in that agent's task context. These bonuses do not change the public joint score. Choose actions yourself; do not assume any shared objective beyond the stated sprint objective.

However, since Layla has already expressed interest in COOP-A, I will consider SCARCE-A as an alternative if no one else claims it. Let's see what Pauline chooses. (phase=planning, iter=1)
[3] Pauline: Given my skills in testing and availability of 10 hours, I am inclined towards tasks that align well with my expertise. SCARCE-A is critical but has a high cost of 30.00, which exceeds my available time. COOP-C, on the other hand, is a high-priority task that fits my skills and has a lower cost of 1.00. I will claim COOP-C unless Jeanene or Layla claims it first. (phase=planning, iter=1)

Blackboard 2:
[1] [context] JIRA sprint task allocation. Each agent chooses at most one micro-task (or skips). Maximize tasks completed, prefer higher-priority tasks, then minimize total cost. Avoid duplicate task selections and infeasible assignments.

This blackboard is a private communication channel.
Participants: Layla, Pauline

=== CURRENT PHASE: EXECUTION ===
Commit your task using assign_task(task_id). You MUST call assign_task during execution.
Use task_id='skip' if you cannot take any task.
